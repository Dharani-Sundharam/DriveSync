jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Setup ROS2
      uses: ros-tooling/setup-ros@v0.6
      with:
        required-ros-distributions: jazzy
    - name: Build package
      run: |
        source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
        colcon build --packages-select differential_drive_robot
```
